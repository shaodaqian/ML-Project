Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u
The relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is not exactly friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teh@@ er@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ sing activities in the Middle East .
The meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disp@@ uted two state solution .
Relations between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u have been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
The relationship between the two has further deterior@@ ated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran &apos;s atom@@ ic programme , .
In March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
The speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time im@@ pending in Israel .
In 9@@ 11 Call , Professor Ad@@ mits to Sho@@ oting Gir@@ l@@ friend
In a 9@@ 11 call , his voice only slightly sha@@ ky , college professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b told police he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and officers needed to get over to their house .
Lam@@ b made a point to say his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was there alive and probably up@@ set , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
In@@ side the home , officers found A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos; body and a hand-@@ written note scri@@ bb@@ led on a white legal p@@ ad : &quot; I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &quot; read the letter authorities say was signed by Lam@@ b .
There was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , had already travel@@ ed 300 miles to the school &apos;s camp@@ us , where police believe he shot and killed a well-@@ liked history professor , E@@ than Schmi@@ dt , in the door@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief L@@ ynn Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m .
He said Lam@@ b made the f@@ ateful 9@@ 11 call some@@ time after that .
By the end of the day , there would be one more death : Lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
A day after the school shooting forced students and fac@@ ul@@ ty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lam@@ b .
The details released by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a tal@@ ented but possibly troub@@ led teacher .
Stu@@ dents said they looked forward to his class .
Police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmi@@ dt himself had included Lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life with .
Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 fac@@ ul@@ ty members , and many students took courses from both .
At the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of problems .
A student who pra@@ ised Lam@@ b , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , said he also seemed ag@@ it@@ ated and j@@ it@@ tery , &quot; like there was something wrong with him . &quot;
Another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said Lam@@ b told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 20@@ 14-@@ 15 academic year .
Lam@@ b had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
This year , he was only teaching two online classes .
Rec@@ ent changes in the university &apos;s hi@@ ring policies meant that the doc@@ torate Lam@@ b had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic ten@@ ure track to become an assi@@ stant professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmi@@ dt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
Those are questions Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
After fle@@ eing the camp@@ us , police later picked up Lam@@ b &apos;s trail when he cro@@ ssed back into Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
Before he could be ap@@ prehen@@ ded , Lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 3@@ 8-@@ cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of Green@@ ville , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Me@@ th@@ el John@@ son .
His car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
It was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b went to that home , though John@@ son said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
Lam@@ b started working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 , in 2009 and taught geograph@@ y and education classes .
He received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
One of Lam@@ b &apos;s long@@ time friends described him as smart , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun@@ ny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
He was quite the hear@@ t@@ thro@@ b back then .
All the girls would melt when he was around , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson sub@@ ur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had apparently been dating for some time .
In the 9@@ 11 call , Lam@@ b said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no record of them ever mar@@ rying .
They had a dog named Ligh@@ tn@@ ing that lived with them at the bri@@ ck house that backs up to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
Police said the dog was OK .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos; ex-@@ husband , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
&quot; She was completely dev@@ ast@@ ated , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said of his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had not met Lam@@ b but heard through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played the blu@@ es .
Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
Later , they played together in the occa@@ sional gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a di@@ mly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he last saw Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss the night of S@@ ept . 5 , after Lam@@ b had finished playing his guitar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
There was no sign of anything am@@ is@@ s .
&quot; Just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
We were cutting up and thro@@ wing one-@@ lin@@ ers at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wi@@ t about them .
Schmi@@ dt , the sla@@ in professor , directed the first-@@ year seminar program and specialized in N@@ ative American and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three young children .
He studied at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his fr@@ at@@ ernity and student government .
On the Delta State camp@@ us in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including fac@@ ul@@ ty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a cand@@ le@@ light mem@@ orial .
Schmi@@ dt &apos;s wife , Li@@ z , and brother Je@@ ff Schmi@@ dt also attended the vi@@ gi@@ l , during which the university cho@@ ir s@@ ang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Gra@@ ce . &quot;
Cl@@ asses resume Wednesday .
&quot; We &apos;re trying to get our students to come back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ ge@@ lio Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
Associ@@ ated Press writers E@@ mi@@ ly Wag@@ ster Pet@@ tus in Green@@ ville , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i , and Re@@ be@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Or@@ le@@ ans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lam@@ b made the 9@@ 11 call after shooting Schmi@@ dt , and that while Lam@@ b referred to Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in the 9@@ 11 call , there is no indication the two ever married .

UN Chief Sa@@ ys There Is No Military Sol@@ ution in Syria
Secretary-General B@@ an Ki@@ -@@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s step@@ ped up military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five-@@ year conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen the violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
The U.@@ N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.@@ N@@ . Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sid@@ el@@ ines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministeri@@ al session later this month to discuss Syria .
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syri@@ an people and regional powers &quot; made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l Num@@ bers That Show Donald Tru@@ mp Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ pper .
Others have dis@@ missed him as a jo@@ ke .
And some are holding out for an imp@@ lo@@ sion .
But no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to drag Donald Tru@@ mp down from at@@ op the p@@ olls , it has@@ n &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
Ten of the last 11 national p@@ olls have shown Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l &apos;s nom@@ ination chances .
Of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
None of this is to say that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
Pun@@ di@@ ts point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nom@@ ination process .
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
But outside groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recogn@@ izing Tru@@ mp &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
Here are some recent pol@@ l numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
Tru@@ mp &apos;s favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
Right before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ d@@ acy in mid-@@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University pol@@ l showed only two in 10 Republi@@ cans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
By mid-@@ July , it was 40 percent .
In early August , it was 52 percent .
Now , six in 10 Republi@@ cans have a favor@@ able view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
Rou@@ ghly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
And these numbers hold up in early states .
A Qu@@ inn@@ i@@ pi@@ ac pol@@ l in I@@ o@@ wa last week found that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans there had a favor@@ able view of Tru@@ mp .
T@@ wo@@ -@@ thirds of G@@ O@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as the nom@@ ine@@ e .
In a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp were the nom@@ ine@@ e .
Only two in 10 say they would be &quot; up@@ set &quot; if he were the nom@@ ine@@ e .
Only Ben Car@@ son generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; v@@ s. 40 percent who say the same of Tru@@ mp ) .
The next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Rub@@ io with only 21 percent .
On the fli@@ p side , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; up@@ set &quot; if establishment favorite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nom@@ ine@@ e .
A majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tru@@ mp &apos;s tem@@ per@@ ament as a problem .
While Donald Tru@@ mp has been widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ ast and insul@@ ts , 52 percent of le@@ an@@ ed Republi@@ can voters nation@@ wide think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per@@ ament to be president , according to Monday &apos;s AB@@ C News / Washington Post pol@@ l .
The same number holds in the first-@@ in-@@ the-@@ nation cau@@ cus state of I@@ o@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think he has the personality to be comm@@ ander in chief , according to Qu@@ inn@@ i@@ pi@@ ac last week .
Still , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independ@@ ents say his tem@@ per@@ ament does not belong in the White House , according to AB@@ C / Post .
Republi@@ can voters are getting used to the idea .
When they put on their pun@@ dit h@@ ats , Republi@@ can voters think Tru@@ mp is for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P nom@@ ination , four in 10 said Tru@@ mp was the best bet , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l out last week .
That &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
Full dis@@ closure : G@@ O@@ P voters haven &apos;t had the cle@@ arest crystal ball in the past .
At this time last cycle , four in 10 Republi@@ cans picked R@@ ick Per@@ ry to win the nom@@ ination , v@@ s. only 28 percent for event@@ ual nom@@ ine@@ e Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
Still , it shows that a plurali@@ ty of G@@ O@@ P voters see Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
Even if Republi@@ cans r@@ al@@ lied around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still be@@ ats almost everyone .
Some pun@@ di@@ ts point out that the sp@@ lin@@ tered field is likely contributing to Tru@@ mp &apos;s lead , while anti-@@ Tru@@ mp support is be spread diff@@ us@@ ely among more than a do@@ zen other candidates .
But a Mon@@ mouth University pol@@ l in early September shows that , in a hy@@ pothe@@ tical head@@ -@@ to-@@ head mat@@ ch@@ up between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
He leads C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina by 13 points , Marco Rub@@ io by 14 points , Wal@@ ker by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e by 33 points each .
He &apos;s in a dead heat with T@@ ed Cruz .
The only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the business@@ man by a wide 19 points in a hy@@ pothe@@ tical head@@ -@@ to-@@ head .
A bare majority of Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
A new C@@ BS / N@@ Y@@ T pol@@ l out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have locked in their votes .
Obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates .
Still , Tru@@ mp &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ si@@ der neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Tru@@ mp .
Six in 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
Even since Donald Tru@@ mp called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 20@@ 16 conversation .
Some are worried that Tru@@ mp &apos;s bom@@ b@@ ast will drive crucial His@@ pan@@ ic voters away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage re@@ br@@ anding efforts .
But according to Monday &apos;s new AB@@ C / Post pol@@ l , six in 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
So as long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , it seems Donald Tru@@ mp will remain too .
Fru@@ stration with government is climbing to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support from Republi@@ can voters , largely due to their out@@ si@@ der status .
Six in 10 Republi@@ cans in Monday &apos;s new AB@@ C / Post pol@@ l say they want a political out@@ si@@ der over someone with government experience .
And they are an@@ gr@@ y at Washington , too .
A Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg pol@@ l in I@@ o@@ wa from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ o@@ wa Republi@@ cans are fru@@ str@@ ated with Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; mad as hell . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt und Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive residential developments are located here in Ho@@ boo@@ ken@@ weg – with a view over the North Sea mu@@ d@@ flat@@ s .
On this road one square met@@ re of a th@@ at@@ ched house costs an average of € 7@@ 3,@@ 300 .
&quot; On Sy@@ lt , the number of properties on offer is naturally limited , &quot; says a study – hence the high prices .
This new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square met@@ re .
Of course , € 18.@@ 70 per square met@@ re for student di@@ gs in Munich is not really low .
Comp@@ ared with Germany &apos;s top areas , however , this price seems likes pe@@ an@@ uts .
Property service En@@ gel &amp; Vol@@ kers has published a le@@ ague table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with stag@@ ger@@ ingly high prices per square met@@ re .
More than € 10,000 is nothing there - per quare met@@ re , mind you .
O@@ k , if you can &apos;t afford it ...
In@@ ci@@ dentally , for once Munich is not in the lead .
Champ@@ ions League : Bayern off to a dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
Double goal sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us : Bayern star Thomas Müller is simply on a roll .
A lucky goal from Thomas Müller p@@ av@@ ed the way for a 3 : 0 victory for FC Bayern at Ol@@ yp@@ i@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us - then it got better .
A confident start to the Champ@@ ions League season .
World champ@@ ions Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e brought about a dream start to their &quot; Milan Mission &quot; in the see@@ thing cau@@ l@@ dr@@ on at Pi@@ re@@ aus .
Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola &apos;s team won their opening match in the Champ@@ ions League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders , thanks to Müller &apos;s bra@@ ce ( 5@@ 2nd and 90@@ th minutes + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ e &apos;s goal ( 8@@ 9th minute ) , ending in a score of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The t@@ wel@@ f@@ th successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 20@@ 16 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to end his third attempt by taking the trop@@ h@@ y back to Munich .
With his 28@@ th goal in the Champ@@ ions League , Müller took Bayern into the lead with the gra@@ cious help of O@@ ly@@ mi@@ ac@@ os go@@ ali@@ e Rober@@ to , who let through a cross shot from the world champion .
&quot; We aren &apos;t going to under@@ estimate them , &quot; promised Bayern cap@@ tain Phil@@ li@@ pp L@@ ah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ akis Stadium in front of 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich player kept his word .
They demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being show@@ y .
Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us had won their six most recent premi@@ ere class home games , including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ le@@ tico Madrid and Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
In 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund st@@ umb@@ led here too .
But Bayern , un@@ defe@@ ated in seven Europa Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
They went to work bol@@ dly , but often too un@@ inspired in their offensive efforts .
Att@@ acks were too often initiated by bringing left w@@ inger Dou@@ glas Costa , who rarely got past former Brun@@ swi@@ ck player O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i , into play .
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field dro@@ ve into the top left corner of the goal .
In the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ o@@ wski had the best opportunities in the first half .
First when Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown hit the P@@ ole &apos;s he@@ ader from the line in the 26@@ th minute .
Then with a shot which the go@@ ali@@ e par@@ ried with his kne@@ e in the 35@@ th minute .
Although Bayern is used to playing a dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us were able to need@@ le them .
But they could count on go@@ al@@ keep@@ er Manuel Neu@@ er .
For example when he ste@@ ered a shot from Ide@@ ye over the cross@@ bar in the 5@@ 6th minute .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four-@@ man back@@ field defence deployed in front of Neu@@ er , with David Alba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , back in the squ@@ ad following mus@@ cle problems , initially sat on the sid@@ el@@ ines .
The world cup her@@ o had only been given the green light following final training , said S@@ porting Director Matthias Sam@@ mer on Sky : &quot; If anyone wants to make something else out of that , they are being mali@@ cious &quot; .
At the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought in King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the stri@@ cken Le@@ wand@@ o@@ wski in the 5@@ 9th minute .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal in the 7@@ 6th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; Müller put another one in with a penalty .
Before the match there was a ri@@ ot in the stadium .
After a small group of Bayern fans , some wearing mas@@ ks , had apparently provo@@ ked supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ e@@ us from behind their f@@ ence with words and gest@@ ures , security forces attacked them and used bat@@ ons against the Munich supporters .
At least one Bayern fan was taken injured from the stadium .
S@@ mo@@ kers at a greater risk of losing teeth
S@@ mo@@ kers damage not only their l@@ ungs but also their teeth , concludes a long-term study in Pots@@ dam .
The good news is : if you give up the risk decre@@ ases fast .
S@@ mo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
This emer@@ ges from a long-term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for N@@ ut@@ ri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Pots@@ dam .
Comp@@ ared to non-@@ smo@@ kers , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely is between 2.5 and 3.@@ 6 times higher for smo@@ kers .
The scientists monitored more than 23@@ ,@@ 300 participants .
The main reasons for to@@ oth loss are c@@ aries and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the g@@ ums , the DI@@ f@@ E states .
S@@ moking is a risk factor for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , emphasise the authors .
The connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent g@@ um infl@@ amm@@ ation in smo@@ kers .
It has not been clarified to what extent smoking raises the risk of c@@ aries .
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of D@@ ental Research &quot; .
It could however take 10 years before the danger once more drop@@ s to the level of non-@@ smo@@ kers &apos; , declared lead author Thomas Di@@ et@@ rich of the University of Birmingham in England .
People should be persu@@ aded to become non-@@ smo@@ kers , declared study leader H@@ einer Bo@@ eing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; S@@ moking shor@@ tens the li@@ fes@@ p@@ an &quot; .
Not smoking is good for the l@@ ungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age .
In Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by to@@ o@@ th@@ less@@ ness , according to the DI@@ f@@ E .
Ear@@ lier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early to@@ oth loss .
The new long term study substanti@@ ates these findings .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rhine at Cologne
Arch@@ ae@@ ological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists from the Roman German@@ ic Museum have un@@ earth@@ ed sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rhine Bou@@ levard is being constructed , said museum Director Mar@@ cus Tri@@ er on Tuesday .
Hist@@ ori@@ ans have been in search of so-called architectural monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine .
The museum , as the department for archaeological monument conservation , is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of Cologne .
The archae@@ ologists made a find in the third construction phase of the Rh@@ ein Bou@@ levard .
It is already known from text documents that a fortress stood on this spot in the 4th century , and in the 8th century a church , explained Tri@@ er .
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a c@@ eme@@ tery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belon@@ ged to the church , has also been discovered .
Young woman hit by goods train
After a young woman met with an accident at the station in Gei@@ len@@ kir@@ chen@@ -@@ Lin@@ dern , police are asking for help from the general public .
Early on Wednesday morning , at about 1 : 40 a.m. , the young woman cro@@ ssed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a goods train coming from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
According to the Federal police she suffered severe inj@@ uries from the accident .
She was treated at the site by an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by amb@@ ul@@ ance .
Investi@@ g@@ ating officers have no idea why the young woman was crossing the tracks at night .
It is possible that the event was observed by witn@@ esses or residents may have heard something .
This may apply to residents of or people passing by the Lin@@ dern station , Zie@@ gel@@ b@@ ä@@ cker@@ weg , Th@@ om@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Strasse ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
Any information that can be provided about the cause of the accident can be given by calling the free 24-hour police hot@@ line on 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88 8@@ 000 or at any police station .
EU Commission proposes new court in contro@@ vers@@ y over TT@@ IP
To def@@ use the contro@@ vers@@ y over the planned Tran@@ satlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership , TT@@ IP , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
According to this , the disp@@ uted private arbit@@ ration board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds considerably more in its function to traditional courts .
&quot; We want to set up a system which citizens trust , &quot; stated the responsible EU Commissioner , C@@ ec@@ ilia Mal@@ ström , when introducing it .
The Swe@@ de plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
The German government has announced its support .
The creation of TT@@ IP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
Plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
They should come in equal propor@@ tions from the EU , the USA and from non-@@ member countries .
For the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
This would allow for appe@@ als to be made against jud@@ gements .
Up to now , the parties to proceedings have agreed on the arbitr@@ ator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their jud@@ gements .
In the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system to be fair and just , comm@@ ented Mal@@ ström .
In the long term , according to her statement , she wants to aim at an international investment court .
In this , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be cle@@ ared up .
Invest@@ or State Dis@@ p@@ ute Sett@@ lement ( IS@@ DS ) , which is required particularly by large companies , is said to be one of the main reasons for the sti@@ ff opposition to the TT@@ IP in Europe .
Tradi@@ tional arbit@@ ration courts are criticised by ad@@ vers@@ aries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax pa@@ yers , make national laws n@@ ull and void , or enforce a lower@@ ing of consumer and environmental protection standards .
In initial reactions , anti TT@@ IP organisations such as Cap@@ act called the EU Commission &apos;s proposals inadequate .
There was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
The German Secretary of State for the Economy , Matthias Mach@@ ni@@ g ( SP@@ D ) , on the other hand , referred to the plans as major progress .
The Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Econom@@ ics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabri@@ el developed with other EU trade ministers .
The old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is off the table .
The French government , too , welcomed Mal@@ ström &apos;s plans .
The European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restri@@ cting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules .
Small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged , they said .
When talks over the TT@@ IP free trade agreement can be concluded was still unclear on Wednesday .
Ne@@ goti@@ ations have been taking place since the middle of 2013 .
The issue of investor protection , however , has to date not been discussed with the USA .
It was originally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year .
This date is no longer ten@@ able .
Ex@@ qui@@ site folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens in Hamburg
Ele@@ ven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens si@@ ts on the stage in the Prime Club ( now Lux@@ or ) in Cologne .
Be@@ side him stands a fli@@ p chart on which the sh@@ y-@@ seem@@ ing folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Mich@@ ig@@ an in fel@@ t-@@ tip pen .
The entire audience , some 40 people , is virtually mes@@ mer@@ ised by Ste@@ vens &apos;s performance .
Refer@@ ring to different places , which each time he marks on the map , he talks about the stories behind his me@@ ticul@@ ously and sub@@ tly contri@@ ved songs .
Where they origin@@ ated , and what it looks like , in his home country .
Since then Ste@@ vens has proved himself to be a wonder@@ fully creative nut@@ case .
His third album , &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; , released in 2003 , features cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs which cling harmon@@ ically to the traditions of American folk rock of the late six@@ ties , but which might dri@@ ft at any time into amazing op@@ ul@@ ence .
Rum@@ our has it that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; was the first part of a bold series : it was to have been followed by songs about each of the 50 United States .
But in 2004 in the Rhine area , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; came out , bur@@ sting positive expectations .
Ste@@ vens seems to have down@@ sized here .
Pla@@ ying live he only needs a guitar and ban@@ jo .
One year later the New Yor@@ k-@@ based musi@@ cian returns to his series .
With &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens Inv@@ ites You To : Come On Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ o@@ ise &quot; ) in 2005 , a widely acc@@ laimed master@@ piece is released .
Ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant with ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic sophistic@@ ation .
The album clim@@ bs the American B@@ ill@@ board charts and appears in every best album of the year list in the influential music press .
After extremely productive experiments Ste@@ vens then serves up &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , an elabor@@ ate electronic set piece .
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchest@@ rated , but supported by program@@ med sequ@@ ences or be@@ ats and plays with a variety of effects and echo@@ es .
Long since moved on from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here are becoming colourful spectac@@ les with ne@@ on head@@ bands and huge flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent stage decor@@ ations .
Currently Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens is tour@@ ing Germany as part of a five-@@ man band .
Hamburg Mehr kept in the dark !
Since March the theatre has primarily presented &quot; Car@@ ri@@ e and Lo@@ well &quot; .
Although an audience of almost 2000 sit sp@@ ell@@ bound in their seats , the clearly more mature Ste@@ vens returns to intim@@ acy and to folk .
Without direc@@ ting a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enrich@@ ed album .
From the audience one can hear : the performance is more &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; and it makes you want to &quot; ch@@ u@@ ck away the album &quot; .
Only with his en@@ core does Ste@@ vens give his modest thanks , play a few of his older songs acou@@ stically and finally take a bow to th@@ under@@ ous ap@@ plause .
Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n to make de@@ but at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions
Since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s de@@ but at PM@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ en@@ ly awa@@ ited
New Labour leader Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his de@@ but at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions later , taking on David Cam@@ eron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six al@@ lot@@ ted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely scrut@@ in@@ ised by the media and Labour MP@@ s .
He has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly show@@ piece .
He has also said he could ski@@ p some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cab@@ inet and his speech to the TU@@ C annual congress on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national an@@ them at a service on Tuesday to mark the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the B@@ attle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MP@@ s and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
A spo@@ kes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respec@@ tful silence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the B@@ attle of Britain . &quot;
But a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told BBC Two &apos;s News@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them &quot; irrespective &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ arch@@ y should be abolished .
N@@ early a do@@ zen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , c@@ iting differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspon@@ dent Rob@@ in Bran@@ t says policy differences are also &quot; st@@ acking up &quot; within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
H@@ ours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secre@@ tary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cam@@ eron has faced across the des@@ patch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crowd s@@ our@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to ask Mr Cam@@ eron and has been given more than 30@@ ,000 suggestions .
The Is@@ ling@@ ton North M@@ P has said PM@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; repar@@ tee &quot; and trading bar@@ bs , instead vo@@ wing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow business secre@@ tary , will de@@ pu@@ tise for him at PM@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cam@@ eron is travelling abroad .
He has also flo@@ ated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had appro@@ ached the Commons Spe@@ aker John Ber@@ cow to discuss the issue .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cam@@ eron said he wanted to move away from the &quot; Pun@@ ch and Ju@@ dy &quot; style of politics often associated with PM@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
Since it was first tel@@ ev@@ ised in 1990 , PM@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key bar@@ ometer of a leader &apos;s jud@@ gement , their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MP@@ s although critics have argued it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and is in need of far-reaching reforms .

Po@@ und rises as UK wage growth acceler@@ ates
The po@@ und j@@ ump@@ ed following data showing a pi@@ ck-@@ up in UK wage growth , while the FT@@ SE 100 was led higher by bid target SA@@ B@@ Mil@@ ler .
Between May and July , UK earnings excluding bon@@ uses grew 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period last year .
The rate was the fastest since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
Ster@@ ling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 30 .
The FT@@ SE 100 index closed up 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Mil@@ ler was the stand@@ -@@ out stock on the market , j@@ umping 20 % after it received a bid approach from ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
A deal would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wers , bringing together brands such as Bud@@ wei@@ ser , Stell@@ a Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher following encouraging news from ri@@ val luxury goods group Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ ont &apos;s latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - had begun to grow again .
Sha@@ res in G@@ len@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.@@ 5@@ bn through a share placement as part of its deb@@ t-@@ cutting strategy .
Sha@@ res in packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest fall@@ ers on the index , down 4.@@ 3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s cut its rating on the firm to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose 3.1 % after the spor@@ ts@@ wear firm reported an 83 % jump in half-@@ year pre-@@ tax profits to £ 4@@ 6.@@ 6@@ m .
J@@ D Sports bo@@ ss says higher wages could hur@@ t expansion
J@@ D Sports Executive Chairman Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more spending power in the po@@ ckets of potential consumers . &quot;
But that spending power is unlikely to out@@ wei@@ gh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
The costs could hit J@@ D Sports &apos; expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
Jus@@ tin B@@ ie@@ ber in the capital city : on a B@@ ie@@ ber ex@@ pedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin B@@ ie@@ ber , me@@ gast@@ ar .
A ridicul@@ ous 21 years young , a wi@@ mp@@ y k@@ id with a too trendy hair@@ cut .
The guy with the plat@@ in@@ um bl@@ ond hair is worth a hundred million euros .
Pro@@ b@@ ably even more .
At the moment Mon@@ sie@@ ur B@@ ie@@ ber is in Berlin .
And the under-@@ 17 generation is going ber@@ ser@@ k .
Like Wi@@ kt@@ oria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
The 15-@@ year-old has never heard the name Rit@@ z Carl@@ ton .
Not so bad .
H@@ und@@ reds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
Inclu@@ ding E@@ va and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
But the Pol@@ es have been sitting on the cold stone sla@@ b in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the Pots@@ damer Platz since 7 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning .
The B@@ ie@@ ber building : their i@@ do@@ l , whose face appears on huge numbers of post@@ ers in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , has been staying here since Monday evening .
The suite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother E@@ wa ear@@ ns in six months .
At least .
She says : &quot; My Vi@@ kt@@ oria should really be sitting in the 10th class in the gram@@ mar school at the moment . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m fulfilling her dream for her . &quot;
Comp@@ ulsory education ?
Who wants that ?
Not the fans .
Nor B@@ ie@@ ber himself .
He is financially secure anyway .
He is earning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Super Bow@@ l , a two-@@ year deal with an anti-@@ spot company p@@ ours many many dollars into B@@ ie@@ ber &apos;s account .
And for every dol@@ l that looks like him and passes over the counter B@@ ie@@ ber cas@@ hes in as well .
When Jus@@ tin B@@ ie@@ ber drinks coffee people go@@ ggle through the window .
He has lo@@ oted more than a hundred million like that .
Some say the h@@ ype goes too far .
Others point out that after all B@@ ie@@ ber is char@@ ting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at number one .
B@@ ie@@ ber himself , whose new album is due out in November , is not interested in all those zer@@ os .
At least that &apos;s what he says .
Pe@@ gi@@ da po@@ ster suggests the idea of pot@@ ato don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s to Leban@@ ese man
Pot@@ ato@@ es or don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab ?
You can have both – in the pot@@ ato k@@ eb@@ ab that Ol@@ den@@ burg snack bar owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has created .
Inspi@@ red by the s@@ logan &quot; pot@@ ato@@ es instead of k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s &quot; on a Pe@@ gi@@ da movement po@@ ster , Al@@ ha@@ y put pot@@ ato@@ es and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
A po@@ ster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the s@@ logan &quot; Pot@@ ato@@ es instead of k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s &quot; which he happened to see on television gave him the idea .
Since then a sp@@ it laden with meat and pot@@ ato@@ es has been rot@@ ating in his shop .
&quot; That is multi-@@ cultural food ! &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
Now he has registered his idea at the patent office in Munich .
According to officials there it is now protected as a registered design .
Because of this , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal how much meat and how many pot@@ ato@@ es the sp@@ it holds .
Just enough so that , &quot; They taste much better together , &quot; he reck@@ ons .
Customers also appreciate this international culinary understanding .
